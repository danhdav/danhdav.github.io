I am in the process of integrating my academic webpage and my github pages site onto here. Because I just got the hang of Hugo, it will take quite some time, so your patience is much appreciated. Sorry to any friends or potential job recruiters out there.

In the meantime, you can check out my GitHub and LinkedIn below.
