Here is a collection of places I have visited over the course of living in Europe for five months:

|Place|Description|
|---|---|
|Spain|Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Bilbao. I also did small day trips around those cities like Tarragona, Donostia-San Sebastian, and Toledo.|
|Morocco|I did a small tour to Merzouga starting from Marrakesh. There were many stops along Ait Ben Haddou and Ouarzazate. The final day consisted of a day trip to Essouaira.|
|Côte d'Azur|I stayed within Antibes, Éze, and Nice. A day trip to Monaco from Nice for via bus ride was 2 euros.|
|Scotland|I went to visit family in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and completed a tour around Dunfermline and Stirling, but did not have time for the Highlands.|
|West Germany|My trip here started in Heidelberg and went up along Frankfurt, small cities along the Rhine river (Oberwesel, Bacharach), Bonn, Köln, and Düsseldorf.|

I have put together a nice gallery [here](https://danhdav.github.io/gallery/).

# Important Notes

If you are a very laid-back traveler, I recommend you visit the smaller cities in this list. Places like Donostia-San Sebastian and Essouaira I feel like are too underappreciated; I've literally had the best food of my life there.

Also, Frankfurt is ran by crackheads and I had a terrible experience my first night. I was never really checked for DB tickets, which I am assuming is because it's an honor system around there. After all, they are getting quite expensive. The döners slap though.
