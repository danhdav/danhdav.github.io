For those who do not know, I am currently spending a couple months in Madrid, Spain attending an exchange program. I get asked quite frequently for places that I have been to or plan on visiting, hence I figured to post my iterinary here anyways. I will update this page with brief reviews and insights afterwards. Feel free to reach out for a meet-up.
