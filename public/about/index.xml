      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a firm believer for how technology provides powerful insight on introspection. As AI continues to evolve, we can see parallels between how models behave and how the human mind reflects and learns. This instant access to knowledge through prompt engineering highlights the value of how one can embody this concept from within by keeping the crown open.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Through faith and openness, this is why I strive to remain grounded and self-aware. I realized it’s all within me. I’ve gained enormous strength and insights from the obstacles unconsciously projected in my lifepath. I also like the balance between solitude and connection; while I enjoy meditating and running, I also appreciate engaging in meaningful conversations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
